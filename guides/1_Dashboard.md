# Dashboard #

The [CloudMine Dashboard](/dashboard) is the home for any CloudMine Developer. It letâ€™s developers create new Apps, Hosted Sites, and manage their account.

## Overview
The dashboard has two main components, the sidebar, and the section tabs.

### Sidebar
The sidebar is specific to each part of the dashboard. In order to dig further into an item (Application or Hosted Site) you must have one selected, or if you have none, you must create one.

### Section Tabs
The tabs are above the Applications, and break the dashboard into sections. The first, and main, section is where the Applications are. The second is for all your Hosted Sites on CloudMine. The last section is for managing your account, which includes any SSH keys.

## Apps ##
Creating an application is easy, and should be done before doing any of the tutorials.
